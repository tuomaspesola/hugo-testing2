          As the owner of the key box, you can control the box with our browser-based software, or if your company already uses a reservation system, we can also offer an API interface, through which the systems can communicate the reservation information to each other.

          Our software includes several other functions, such as: <br /><br />
          Entering or removing keys, making reservations, email and SMS messages to clients, monitoring tools for key box activities, optional photos of pick-ups, photos from inside the key box and identifying whether the box is empty or not or, in other words, if the keys have been picked up or returned to the box.<br /><br />
          LivionKey-30 key box will also notify you if it is disconnected or someone tries to move it. If the power is disconnected, the key box will operate for around 5–6 hours on batteries, so short power outages will not prevent the use of the key box
